INTRODUCTION
 
Vehicle owners often face difficulties in managing and scheduling their car maintenance appointments. They may struggle to find a reliable service provider, schedule appointments at a convenient time, or receive updates on the status of their appointments.
 
The car service application provides a solution to these challenges by providing users with a platform to search for service providers, schedule appointments, and receive real-time updates on the status of their appointments. The application makes it easier for vehicle owners to manage their car maintenance and reduces the potential for confusion or miscommunication. The platform also offers the convenience of choosing between drop-off or pick-up options, depending on users’ schedule and preferences. With the application, vehicle owners can have a smooth and stress-free experience when it comes to taking care of their vehicles.
